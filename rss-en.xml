      <link>https://www.theseedsofscience.pub/p/why-arent-smart-people-happier</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Intelligence sounds pretty great. Naturally, people with more of this mental horsepower must live happier lives.

At the time, law professor Lawrence Lessig predicted that the Internet Archive would face copyright battles, but he also believed that the Wayback Machine would change the way the public understood copyright fights. The Internet Archive also began archiving—and then lending—e-books.&lt;/p&gt;
