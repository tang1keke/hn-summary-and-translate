      <title>Chat Control proposal fails again after public opposition</title>
      <link>https://andreafortuna.org/2025/11/01/chat-control-proposal-fails-again-after-massive-public-opposition/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The European Union Council has once again retreated from its controversial Chat Control proposal, a plan that would have required widespread scanning of encrypted messages. Public pressure mounts. What makes this particularly frustrating is that the fundamental problem with Chat Control has never been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TerrorJack October 25, 2025, 1:45pm 1 ghc itself can now run purely client-side in the browser, here’s a haskell playground demo. terms and conditions apply, and i’ll write up more detailed explanation some time later, but i thought this is a cool thing to show off how far the ghc wasm backend has advanced 73 Likes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Show HN: Why write code if the LLM can just do the thing? (web app experiment)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just an LLM with three tools. A web server with zero application code. Just intent and execution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My Shitty Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just drive the hell outta here. There, isn’t that a load off. An apparently inexhaustible supply of alternatives now fills the shelves — books that similarly promise to help you make your peace with the reality that disappointment, frustration, and agony are inexorable parts of life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visible from space, Sudan's bloodied sands expose a massacre of thousands</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another supposedly showed RSF fighters executing civilians moments after pretending to release them. Refugees and aid workers have been warning for 18 months that similar atrocities were likely if El Fasher fell. Reports indicated that the RSF was deliberately forcing displaced civilians eastward into areas under its control, away from humanitarian hubs such as Tawila, where some international agencies were operating.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ask HN: Where to Begin with "Modern" Emacs?</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45783376</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,I’m a longtime Neovim user who’s been EMacs-curious. The hold up for me has been that I’ve been unable to find a source of truth for what’s top-of-the-line as far as plugins are. With Neovim, it’s a safe bet to look at what folks like Folke are doing, but I have struggled to find a similar figure in the Emacs community who gives insight into what’s-what.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The giant basket case countries</title>
      <link>https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-giant-basket-case-countries</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;But the window when developed countries (including China) can afford to treat poor countries like an afterthought is rapidly drawing to a close. But the Big 5 are unusually poor, and poor countries tend to have much higher fertility:Of course we can expect to see the fertility transition accelerate as these countries cross the $7,000 threshold; as you can see on the chart, very few countries maintain high fertility past that level. The countries with rapidly growing populations are those that failed to provide for their people.&lt;/p&gt;
