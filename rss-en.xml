      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was only one problem: The Greenlandic Wikipedia was a mirage. There is nothing other than the text that is inputted. In 2022, a research team from Germany that looked into what data could be obtained by online scraping even found that Wikipedia was the sole easily accessible source of online linguistic data for 27 under-resourced languages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Load-time relocation of shared libraries (2011)</title>
      <link>https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/25/load-time-relocation-of-shared-libraries/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note that shared libraries have many names - shared libraries, shared objects, dynamic shared objects (DSOs), dynamically linked libraries (DLLs - if you're coming from a Windows background). But if it does use shared libraries (as do the vast majority of Linux applications), symbols taken from these shared libraries need to be relocated, because of how shared libraries are loaded. Loading shared libraries Unlike executables, when shared libraries are being built, the linker can't assume a known load address for their code.&lt;/p&gt;
