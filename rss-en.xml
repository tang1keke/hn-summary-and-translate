      <title>Avoid 2:00 and 3:00 am cron jobs (2013)</title>
      <link>https://www.endpointdev.com/blog/2013/04/avoid-200-and-300-am-cron-jobs/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Avoid 2:00 and 3:00 am cron jobs. Most of the time such cron jobs will run fine, but if they run every Sunday morning, then twice per year they will run at the exact time daylight savings time (aka summer time) kicks in or ends, sometimes with very strange results. On Linux with vixie-cron we saw two cron jobs run something like once per second between 3:00 and 3:01 when the most recent daylight savings time began.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>fnox, a secret manager that pairs well with mise</title>
      <link>https://github.com/jdx/mise/discussions/6779</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;pub $ fnox secret set API_KEY --value "your-secret-value" --provider main Use secrets in your workflow: # Export secrets as environment variables $ fnox exec -- your-command # Get a single secret $ fnox get API_KEY # Shell integration (auto-load secrets on cd) $ fnox shell hook How It Works with mise fnox and mise work independently but complement each other: mise: Manages tools, tasks, and general environment variables fnox: Manages sensitive secrets with encryption and remote storage A typical setup: mise. You might wonder why fnox isn't built into mise. What's going to happen to mise secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;” Someone from Proven responded, saying that McNally only likes “the cheap locks lol because they are easy and fast. McNally took this as a threat.

      <title>Carl Bohland's Auto Wash Bowl (2019)</title>
      <link>https://www.vintag.es/2019/12/the-auto-wash-bowl.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a busy Saturday, about 75 cars per hour would go for a spin in the wash bowl. The first Auto Wash Bowl in Chicago was built by a Chicagoan named C. Just two years later, the North Side wash bowl was bought by a local realtor, the South Side wash bowl was gone by the ‘30s, and the Auto Wash Bowl went down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;
