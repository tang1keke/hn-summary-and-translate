      <title>The profitable startup</title>
      <link>https://linear.app/now/the-profitable-startup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is "understaffed compared to benchmarks. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intent to Deprecate and Remove XSLT</title>
      <link>https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/CxL4gYZeSJA/m/yNs4EsD5AQAJ</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, Chromium would like to deprecate and remove XSLT. Both other browser engines are also planning to deprecate XSLT. Removal of this feature constitutes a compat risk, since sites that use XSLT may stop working when the feature is removed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New analog chip capable of outperforming top-end GPUs by as much as 1000x</title>
      <link>https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/china-solves-century-old-problem-with-new-analog-chip-that-is-1-000-times-faster-than-high-end-nvidia-gpus</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;"Benchmarking shows that our analogue computing approach could offer a 1,000 times higher throughput and 100 times better energy efficiency than state-of-the-art digital processors for the same precision. RELATED STORIES—'Crazy idea' memory device could slash AI energy consumption by up to 2,500 times—'Rainbow-on-a-chip' could help keep AI energy demands in check — and it was created by accident—Scientists create ultra-efficient magnetic 'universal memory' that consumes much less energy than previous prototypesThe researchers said that recent advances in memory hardware could make analog computing viable once again. Configuring the chip in this way meant that the team was able to combine the speed of analog computation with the accuracy normally associated with digital processing.&lt;/p&gt;
