      <title>You can't cURL a Border</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Any government form that asked "where have you been. ¶ That twenty-minute panic before buying a flight comes from one basic problem: none of the systems that judge you will tell you your state. None of that is easily exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons from 70 interviews on deploying AI Agents in production</title>
      <link>https://mmc.vc/research/state-of-agentic-ai-founders-edition/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the ecosystem is in such nascent stages, most (52%) startups are building their agentic infrastructure fully or predominantly in-house. Autonomy: AI agents act independently without needing constant inputs/instructions from humans; they make decisions and take actions (via tool calling) based on the changing world around them. Given the nascence of GenAI-powered agents and assorted reliability issues around them (and enterprise practitioners’ caution around deploying fully autonomous systems), our definition of agents does not require full autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some software bloat is OK</title>
      <link>https://waspdev.com/articles/2025-11-04/some-software-bloat-is-ok</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows 11 Calculator alone consumes more than 30MiB of RAM. Modern software tends to be more complicated. This didn't exist much in older era software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pain Points of OCaml</title>
      <link>https://quamserena.com/2025-11-03/pain-points-of-ocaml</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think that Rust was definitely correct for making type annotations for function parameters and return values explicit despite also being based on Hindley-Milner type inference. My gripe with these is that they are two DSLs that opaquely compile to OCaml source files and have their own (separate) semantics and grammar. They also emit errors where the entire diagnostic is just "Syntax Error", which is difficult to debug considering that these are DSLs with OCaml embedded within them.&lt;/p&gt;
