      <description>&lt;p&gt;It then applies the plan and invokes a clean-up process. We’ll create a DNS Planner process that produces plans, and DNS Enactor processes that pick them up. The incident report also notes that the clean-up process deletes plans that are “significantly older than the one it just applied.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>'This is the big one' – tech firms bet on electrifying rail</title>
      <link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdjg92y00no</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not only that, Mr Murray says it is currently the only solar array in the country that delivers power directly to rail to move trains. To go electric, rail operators have traditionally had two options: electrified rail, or overhead lines that that trains connect to with arm-like pantographs on their roofs. This is why he views solar panels as so useful in enabling railway electrification projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MTurk is 20 years old today – what did you create with it?</title>
      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45792951</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took a few days for people to find it and catch on, but then things got busy. At the time, AWS was about 100 people (when you were on call, you were on call for all of AWS), Amazon had just hit 10,000, S3 was still in private beta, and EC2 was a whitepaper. What did you create with MTurk and the incredibly patient hard-working workforce behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
